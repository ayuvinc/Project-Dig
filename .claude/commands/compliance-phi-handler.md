## What Is PHI

Protected Health Information — any health information that:
1. Relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health of an individual; AND
2. Can be used to identify the individual; AND
3. Is held or transmitted by a covered entity or business associate.

PHI applies when your product is a covered entity (healthcare provider, health plan, healthcare clearinghouse)
or a business associate (vendor/partner processing PHI on behalf of a covered entity).

**If your product does not handle medical records, diagnoses, treatment data, or health insurance data
for covered entities — PHI rules likely do not apply. Verify with legal before assuming.**

2. Geographic data below state level (address, zip code, GPS)
3. All dates (except year) — birth, admission, discharge, death
4. Phone numbers
5. Fax numbers
6. Email addresses
7. Social Security numbers
8. Medical record numbers
9. Health plan beneficiary numbers
10. Account numbers
11. Certificate/licence numbers
12. Vehicle identifiers (VIN, plate)
